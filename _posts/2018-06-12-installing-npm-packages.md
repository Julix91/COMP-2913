#### What is npm?

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager for JavaScript, allowing you to use libraries created by others in your own projects, or share them with others. React is an example of a library that can be managed through npm. Most modern projects use npm to manage their dependencies.

#### How can I see my project's dependencies?

Usually, your project dependencies are listed in **package.json**, at the root of your project. When running the command *npm install*, npm looks into this file to install all of your dependencies and sub-dependencies. All of these dependencies are installed into the node_modules directory by default.
